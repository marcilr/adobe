=============================
During Adobe Scan online presentation at SOA OIT DNR
observed  I have Acrobat Reader Pro installed on
workstation:

  Adobe Acrobat Reader DC v2019.012.20035

Observe that Home > Scans has free Adobe Scan app download:
  Turn your phone of tablet into a portable scanner to
  scan anything to PDF.
